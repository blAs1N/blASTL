# blASTL
My Own STL Production Project.  
This project is for studying data structure.  
This STL will be fast enough to be used in the game.  
Reference are EASTL and Unreal Engine.  
Google Benchmark will be used to measure speed.  
The standard that this STL is following is C++ 17.  
But, it will not add features that have been deprecated in C++ 17.
